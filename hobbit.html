			<h1>The Hobbit: Out of Your Comfort Zone</h1>

			<p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, also known as J. R. R. Tolkien, is an English writer best known for his extraordinary
            creativity and incredible story telling skill. Since his success with The Lord of the Rings trilogy revived the
            genre in the 1950s, he has been considered the father of modern high fantasy literature. While the trilogy is
            without a doubt Tolkien's magnum opus, I find myself gravitating more toward its prequel The Hobbit or There
            and Back Again. The book was first released on September 21, 1939 and was geared more toward young audiences. 
            It was highly acclaimed and remains to this day a classic in children literature. The book follows Bilbo Baggins
            and his companions on their journey to recapture the long-lost family inheritance of one of Bilbo's companion. 
            Over the course of the journey, readers can easily spot an overarching theme, which is sometimes, in order to
            reach your full potential, you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. </p>

            <p>To begin with, at the start of the book, readers are introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who is timid and
            loves nothing more than the comfort of his home. He also leads an extremely quiet life and "never had any
            adventures or did anything unexpected". In other words, Bilbo does not possess the usual traits that a typical
            hero tends to have. Therefore, it is unthinkable that such a person would muster up enough courage to attempt
            to steal something from a group of three hungry trolls. Later, it is solely because of Bilbo's attention
            to detail that Thorin and Company can gain access to the trolls' cave which provides them with some much-needed
            arms and provisions. Was it not for Gandalf's insistence that Bilbo had to be a part of the company, 
            he would probably never realize what he is capable of doing. </p>

            <p>Later in the story, we see that once again, Bilbo and his companions are tested. This time, they are ambushed
            by the goblins while sleeping in a cave resulting in the separation of the hobbit and his friends. Alone
            in the complete darkness, while he has every right to panic and start screaming which would undoubtedly
            lead to his demise, yet he chooses to get on his feet and begin walking without knowing where the path
            may lead him. For a person who is terrified of total darkness, I find that to be incredibly brave. After
            that, Bilbo encounters a creature called Gollum and manages to outwit Gollum in the riddle game, thus 
            saving his life. Then, when faces an opportunity to kill the pitiful creature, Bilbo decides against it
            since doing so would not be fair to Gollum, especially when Bilbo is invisible and has a weapon. This
            goes to show that aside from being quick-witted and able to keep calm, he is also extremely ethical.
            These are the qualities that if he was not forced to join the adventure, he would never know that 
            he possesses them. </p>

            <p>Finally, Bilbo once again plays a crucial role when him and the dwarves are besieged by the wood elves 
            and Lake-men. Seeing the stubbornness of Thorin, Bilbo understands that an all-out war between the dwarves 
            and the force of elves and men combined is inevitable and many lives would be wasted needlessly. Therefore, 
            the hobbit decides to take his part of the treasure in the form of the Arkenstone and then give it to the 
            Men to use as a bargaining chip to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Doing so, he risks facing the full wrath of 
            Thorin and his company and could be killed on the spot. No one would have thought that a timid hobbit at the 
            start of the journey would choose to do so. Only through being vigorously tested on his journey that he is 
            able to determine what the right thing is to do in that situation. </p>

            <p>It is now clear that only through being put through hardships that one can reach their full potential.
            That is precisely the reason why I people should always try not to be comfortable for too long and should
            constantly look for challenges to conquer. Only by doing so that one would be able to be the best version 
            of themselves. </p>
