			<h1>The Paternus Trilogy: A Review</h1>
		</div>
		<div id="content">
			<p>Anyone who knows me know that I have never turned down a good fantasy book series. Naturally, the Paternus Trilogy by Dyrk Ashton has attracted
			my attention from the very moment that the first book was published. The series is an urban fantasy book series, which was said to have brilliant
			world building and a captivating plot. However, due to a long to-read list and me rereading the Harry Potter series at the time, I did not have a
			chance to start reading the series until the second book was released. After devouring the first and the second installment of the series in three
			days, I could not recall ever being so mad at myself for not picking up the series sooner. And then, in June this year, the much anticipated third
			installment War of Gods was published, providing a fitting end to an excellent series.</p>

			<p>The world of Paternus is set in a modern world where everything is relatively normal, except for the fact that there are supernatural beings
			walking among us. Not only that, but those beings come from a plethora of mythologies around the world. In the first book, we are introduced to
			two normal college students Fiona Paterson and Zeke Prisco who both have jobs at the local hospital where they take care of old patients. One day,
			a group of strangers show up at their work demanding to see Fi's charge and claiming the patient to be their father. Before Fi and Zeke know it,
			the world as they know it has been completely flipped upside down. From two completely normal college students, they find themselves caught up war
			between two factions that has been ongoing for millions of years. At first glance, the plot may sound a little generic and boring. However,
			Dyrk Ashton has done an incredible job and handled the plot extraordinarily well. </p>

			<p>But he did not manage to do that from the start of the series. It is a general consensus among the readers that the first half of the first
			installment starts off sluggishly and is full of hit-or-miss scenes. Once the book reaches part two however, the book starts to find its own voice
			and became an absoutely action-packed book. Likewise, the second book proves to be the same animal as the second part of book one. It constantly
			keeps the readers on edge and the ever-changing point of view helps to create cliffhanger after cliffhanger. Even I, a person who find the multiple
			points of view distracting thus make it hard to connect to the character, find that the alternating points of view work extremely well with this
			series. In addition, throughout the second book, Dyrk Ashton has shown that he is not only good at writing combat scenes, but he is also a master
			at provoking the readers' emotions. I caught myself laughing and crying with the characters many times. And finally, the third book is a definitely
			a worthy ending to the series. It begins much in the same way as the second book, slowly building up the tension for the final act. I think it would
			be a total disservice to Dyrk Ashton to say that the final battle is good. I have always found the long final battles can be fatiguing at times in
			other book series. However, the final act in the third book was handled beautifully. Despite it taking up almost half of the book, I never caught
			myself wishing the battle had been shorter. Again, Ashton has repeatedly demonstrated that he is getting better with each installment. Gone is the
			off writings in the first half of the first book, the all-out battle is full of well-written action sequences. Gargantuan titans clashing, mythological
			gods slaying armies with a mere wave of a hand, the vampires and werewolves being used as cannon fodders, this battle has it all. In short, there is
			only one word that can be used to describe it, epic.</p>

			<p>Aside from the excellent action sequences, the strongest driving force of the series for me would undoubtedly be the mythologies that Ashton has ingeniously
			woven into the world of Paternus. Truth be told, it was the mythological aspect of the series that caught my attention in the first place. Having always
			been fascinated with stories about supernatural entities from around the world, I started reading Paternus with the hope that I would be able to acquire 
			some more myths from around the world and the series certainly delivered. Just by reading the books, you can immediately tell the staggering amount of 
			research that has gone into writing them. Not only are the featured gods and monsters extremely well researched, but there are not any limits in terms of 
			the origins of the entities. To name a few, the series includes Tengu from Japan, Sun Wukong from China, Cù Sìth from Scotland, Kali from India, Thor from
			Norse mythology, Mokosh from Slavic mythology, and Wendigo from the folklore of First Nations Algonquin tribes. Those are only some of a few entities that 
			I feel are worth mentioning. Needless to say, for people who are particularly interested in mythologies, this series is a must-read. </p>

			<p>So, there is no doubt that the Paternus has become one of my most favourite urban fantasy series. Despite having a pace problem in the first half
			of the first book, the author has rapidly improved to deliver an impressive plot. In addition, the amazing world building and the immense effort put into
			researching the mythology for the series have raised the series to a new level. Therefore, if you are a fan of fantasy books and mythology, I would
			strongly recommend you picking up the Paternus.</p>
